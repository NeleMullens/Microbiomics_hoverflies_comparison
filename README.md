Code used to calculate the comparison of the microbiome of three hoverfly species and the western honeybee

### This repository contains all R scripts used in the analysis found in the articel "Exploring pollinator microbiomes: a comparative study of hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) and honeybees (Hymenoptera: Apidae)"
The scripts only contain the analysis executed in R
Scripts are present in a numbered fasion, starting with cleaning in script 0, alpha diversity analysis in script 1 and ALDEx2 analysis in script 2. The code for the creation of the figures are present in another separate script.
